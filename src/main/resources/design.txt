There are two main subsystems:
    * Damage Control
    * Pet Management

Although only Wolves are supported as Pets, eventually, all tameables (horses, cats, etc.) will be supported.  In this
document, a supported Pet type will be indicated by <pet type>.



Pet Damage Control
    Pet damage control is done through the config file.  Two listeners are employed:

        * EntityDamageListener: Controls damage in two situations:  One, for when there is no "damager", e.g. your Pet
                stands on a magma block or falls from a great height.  Two, when the damager is a mob (i.e. a non-Player
                character).  This listener is controled via damage.<pet type>.* in config.yml:

                    damage:
                       wolf:
                          - BLOCK_EXPLOSION
                          - CONTACT
                          - DRAGON_BREATH
                          - DROWNING
                          - ENTITY_ATTACK
                          - ENTITY_EXPLOSION
                          - ENTITY_SWEEP_ATTACK
                          - FIRE
                          - FALL
                          - FALLING_BLOCK
                          - LAVA
                          - HOT_FLOOR
                          - PROJECTILE

                So, damage.wolf.PROJECTILE can protect your Pet from a skeleton's arrows or a pillager's crossbow, but
                not your own bow / crossbow, nor the bow / crossbow of other players.  Some DamageTypes are not listed
                above.  I could implement them pretty easily if anyone really wanted them (maybe SUFFOCATION?).

                TAKE NOTE: THE CONFIG SHOWS ALLOWABLE DAMAGE!  The # character is the comment character.  Compare:

                damage:                                 damage:
                   wolf:                                   wolf:
                      - BLOCK_EXPLOSION                       # - BLOCK_EXPLOSION
                      - CONTACT                               # - CONTACT
                      - DRAGON_BREATH                           - DRAGON_BREATH

               On the left-hand side, your Pet will experience BLOCK_EXPLOSION, CONTACT, and DRAGON_BREATH damage.  On
               the right-hand side, it will only experience DRAGON_BREATH damage.

        * EntityDamageByEntityListener: Controls damage to your Pet when the damager is a Player, either you (the Pet's
                owner) or someone you're playing with.  It's controled by damage_player.<pet>.* in config.yml:

                damage_player:
                   wolf:
                     - OWNER_ATTACK
                     # - OTHER_ATTACK
                     - OWNER_PROJECTILE
                     - OTHER_PROJECTILE

                In the above configuration, the Pet will be vulnerable to all projectile attacks (e.g. your bow or your
                co-op player's bow) and your attack (e.g. with a sword or pickaxe) but not your co-op player's attack.
